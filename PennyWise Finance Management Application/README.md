# PennyWise: Finance Management Application

## About
Our user-friendly finance management app addresses the problem of financial illiteracy by simplifying
expense tracking by allowing the user to see all of their expenses on one screen. In our app, 
users are able to log, categorize, and edit their own expenses. Also, the app provides a clear and 
comprehensive overview of usersâ€™ financial activity. It assists iniden tifying unnecessary fees, 
subscriptions, and hidden costs by offering insights into their spending habits and consolidating 
all of their expenditures. Setting budget goals and receiving expenditure alerts helps people stay on top of their finances.
Visualizing financial literacy and expenditures through expense reports/categorizations, bill reminders,
and more makes it easy to understand where your money is going. This app allows individuals to make
informed financial decisions, reduce their spending, and save money by eliminating unnecessary
expenses. Knowing how to save money is crucial and our application will serve as a valuable tool to
improve financial awareness.
